Description

    I decided to try something noone else has before. 
    I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning. 
    I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure! vuln.c (https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/62f47b5b65ec7eadb96c4e34f016f68d/vuln.c)

    nc mercury.picoctf.net 53437

Solution:

    printf can be exploited in the format is not specified. The format was not specified therefore we exploited the function
    by adding "%x" many times into the program vuln.c. The output was in hex numbers so we converted it to ascii and then reversed the order
    using:

        s = "ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n4cdbae52Ã¿"}
        >>> for i in range(0, len(s), 4):
        ...     print(s[i + 3] + s[i + 2] + s[i + 1] + s[i], end="" )

        The output received was: picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_bdc425ea}
