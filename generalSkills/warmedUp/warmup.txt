    What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?

Solution:

    So in order to make the converstion from hex to decimal we
    multiply the last number by 1 and then the following numbers all
    get multiplied by 16 and the number of 16's increases each position until there are no numbers.

    So in our example we multiplied D(13) by 1 and 3 (after 0x) by 16.

    The result we add:

        13 x 01 = 13
        03 x 16 = 48
        ----------- 
               = 61
