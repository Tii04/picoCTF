Description

    Can you find the flag in file? (https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/315d3325dc668ab7f1af9194f2de7e7a/file)
    This would be really tedious to look through manually,
    something tells me there is a better way.

Solution

	Use the grep command to extract the desired data out of the file.
	Include the command grep, then type part of the desired data, as well as the file that you're extracting from. 

	command: grep picoCTF {file_name}
