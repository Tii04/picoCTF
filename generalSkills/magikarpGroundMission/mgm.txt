Description

    Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container,
    `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin.
    Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `6d448c9c`.

    SSH: ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 49431

Solution:

    first we ssh into the secure shell by typing in all of what has been provided.
    Then we move around getting the different parts of the flags and the instructions by
    looking at the different .txt files. Once we have completed that we will then be able to see 
    how the flag comes together.
